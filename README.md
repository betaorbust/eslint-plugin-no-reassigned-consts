# Disallow Reassignments of consts and Const-named variables (no-reassigned-consts)

Reassigned constant values are usually an indication of a bug or a mis-labeled variable.
This rule will disallow reassigning consts or variables named like consts. (default: ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE)

For more information on the rule itself, see the [rule doc](docs/no-reassigned-consts).
